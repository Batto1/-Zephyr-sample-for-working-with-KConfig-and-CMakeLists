# Zephyr sample for working with KConfig and CMakeLists
 
This repository contains a Zephyr dummy example to simply showcase how KConfig and CMakeLists files can be used for building the codebase existing in nested files and integrating configuration options both for the build process and the application utilization.


### Building and running

- nRF Connect SDK is used when building and is run with nRF52840DK board. SDK and Toolchain version used: 2.6.0
- Should be able to be built without nRF Connect SDK and with Zephyr only as. Other supported boards can be used, too. Further explanation in repository given in References section can be used for further detail.
